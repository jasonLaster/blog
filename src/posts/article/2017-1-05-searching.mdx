Working on a Debugger presents new challenges everyday.
Some of them are expected and exciting like formatting JS promises.
Others surprise you and are in hindsight totally obvious.

Search selections are one of those challenges that in hindsight are totally obvious,
but the story is anything but.

Back in August, we started working on a new editor search bar with the help of the
great [@Helenvholmes][helen]. The feature called for a search matches count and
search match outlines.

The matches would also have a selected match, which would iterate
as the user typed `<enter>` or shift `<enter>`.
The designs called for the selected match to be highlighted in garish yellow!

I worked on a simple [first version][search-bar-pr] that showed the match count and selected match in light grey.
I didn't have time to style the match yellow I guess...

I filed an issue in October for [outlining matches][initial-issue].
[@Bomsy][bomsy] grabbed the issue and had a [crazy patch][crazy-patch] in November.
I say crazy because it had bonkers [regexs][regexs] and used a streaming CodeMirror [tokenizer][tokenizer].

At this point, we thought we were done, but there were two bugs that we had not considered.
The first bug was that while this tokenizer worked nicely for one token searches i.e. `this`, it
got confused by multiple searches. It did something like this:

> Look, I found lots of things!

[@Zacquary][zacquary] found that the multiple matches were caused by a CodeMirror `opaque` property.

Unfortunately, fixing the multiple search outlines meant losing the syntax highlighting for the matches. The reason for that is that CodeMirror
applies the syntax highlighting to each token and now that we're outlining an entire match the tokens no longer got their syntax token classes!

[@Bomsy][bomsy] fixed this by making our [token highlighter][craziest-search-pr] even crazier.
We actually borrowed some tips from Chrome's [highlighter][chrome-highlighter].

Here is the working highlighter!

We use software all the time that it we often take the small UI details for granted.
I like this feature because it is something that
I have enjoyed in almost every editor I've used, but never
really considered until working on it.

Thank You [@Helenvholmes][helen], [@Bomsy][bomsy], [@Zacquary][zacquary].
