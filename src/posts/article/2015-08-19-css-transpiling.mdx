It looks like CSS transpiling is here and that's a very good thing for CSS.

Transpiling will let the community try out new official spec features and
experiment with other crazy ideas.

The [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) project looks like the most
popular css transpiler.
There are already [+500](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=postcss-&pa) plugins in NPM.

postcss-loader, postcss-helpers, postcss-opacity, postcss-color, postcss-importanter, postcss-mixins, postcss-circle, postcss-inherit, postcss-calc, postcss-focus, postcss-rows, postcss-urlrewrite, postcss-hide, postcss-functions, postcss-position, postcss-epub, postcss-csssimpl, postcss-constant

Some projects have started using PostCSS plugins to create a unified set
of features. Other projects are using it to design their preferred semantics,
like local css scopes.

I'd like to see how frameworks like SASS and LESS adapt to CSS transpiling. I'd also like to see what the intermediate CSS representation is.
Is there an AST that can be passed around? Is it just text?

#### Examples

There tons of examples of transpiling CSS, but here's a small sample:

_Automagical responsive typography_

```css
.foo {
  font-size: responsive;
}
```

_Native clearfix_

```css
.foo {
  clear: fix;
}
```

_Input pseudo-elements_

```css
input[type="range"]::track {
  height: 2px;
}
```

### CSS Modules (Project)

A *CSS Module* is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.

CSS Modules compile to a low-level interchange format called ICSS or [Interoperable CSS](https://github.com/css-modules/icss), but are written like normal CSS files:

+ [CSS Modules core](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules-loader-core)
+ [CSS Modules docs repo](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)

### Rucksack (Project)

Rucksack makes CSS development less painful, with the features and shortcuts it should have come with out of the box.
