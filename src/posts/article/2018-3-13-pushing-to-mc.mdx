One of the tricky things about working on Firefox is that Mozilla uses Mercurial as the official SVM.
The code is hosted at [http://hg.mozilla.org/](http://hg.mozilla.org/).

If you would like to keep your git workflow, there is a git [clone](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko) on github. And it is easy to clone it.

If you would like to build firefox, you need to add some glue to the underlying mercurial repo because many of the build tools reference
the underlyng mercurial shas. There's a tool called [cinnabar](https://github.com/glandium/git-cinnabar/wiki/Mozilla:-A-git-workflow-for-Gecko-development) for that and [cinnabarify](https://github.com/sole/cinnabarify) for getting setup.

Pushing to mozilla central from git can be a huge pain. So here are the steps I've used.

```bash
g co bookmarks/inbound
g cp stuff
g fetch mozilla
g rebase mozilla/inbound
g push mozilla
```

Here's what it looks like when it works:

Don't ask about the rejection :)
