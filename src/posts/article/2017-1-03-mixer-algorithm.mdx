This morning I sat down to send out our teams first batch of mixer emails inspired by Etsy's [mixer](https://codeascraft.com/2015/09/15/assisted-serendipity/) program.

I quickly realized that it wouldn't be that easy to pair everyone over the course of 15 weeks so I went to Sketch to see if I could design a mixer algorithm.

The design is based off my initial idea of using a round robin approach, but with the insight that when you round robin,
at best half of the people will talk. After each successful round robin, the groups are divided in two. This allows everyone to
speak to each other without the fear of pairing the same two people again.

Please let me know if I missed something.
