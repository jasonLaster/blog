title: Deploying Playwright reports to Vercel
---



The default option for running Playwright tests in Github actions is to generate a playwright report that you can download and view locally. 



This is frustrating for two reasons 

1. Downloading a zip and unzippipping takes longer than simply clicking a link.
2. Viewing traces requires hosting the report with a local server.

There are several paid solutions that will host reports and provide CI analytics, but if you simply want to easily view the report there aren't any documented options.



### Enter Vercel

The obvious solution is to deploy the playwright report to Vercel. Vercel satisfies a couple of requirements

1. Vercel is super flexible and even supports hosting simple HTML web pages
2. Vercel supports preview branches which gives you a unique URL for each report



The way I got setup was to first deploy a playwright-report which i had locally. This walked me through the steps of creating a Vercel project. Once I had a project, then all I had to do was add this step to our existing Github workflow.

```yaml
- name: Deploy playwright report to Vercel
  run: |
    cd playwright-report
    vercel link --project playwright-reports --yes --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
    vercel deploy --yes --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```



The step uses `vercel link` to tell Vercel which project I want to deploy to. And then uses `vercel deploy` to create a new preview branch for the report.



```bash
Run cd playwright-report
