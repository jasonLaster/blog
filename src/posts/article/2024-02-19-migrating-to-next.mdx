title: "Migrating to my personal site to NextJS"
categories: blog

In 2014, I published a simple Jekyll site to a [github page](https://jasonlaster.github.io/) so that I'd have a place to share some of the things that I was learning about how Browser DevTools worked. It's kind of fun to go back and look at the early posts about how the Firefox Debugger pauses and how Function Object Preview Popups are shown.

None of this content has gone viral and if we're being honest, it was mostly an outlet for me to think through how I'd teach others some of these concepts. Fast forward to today, and I'm still rocking a Jekyll site hosted on Github Pages in 2014. Worst part, while I'd managed to share 4-8 learnings a year up to 2018, when I started Replay, life got too busy and I stopped sharing.

But honestly, I miss having an outlet where it was easy to share what I was learning and these days I'm learning more than I've ever learned before. In fact one can argue that if i'm not learning, i'm not doing my job right. So I'm excited to bring my site to the the 21st century. Adopting NextJS was an obvious choice. Building it on top of Dmitry Belyaev open-sourced starter template inspired by Brian Lovin's personal site was also an obvious choice.

But... like all software projects, it was not without learnings. So I'll share a
couple of them here in the hope that it'll help other folks make the move.
