## Apps

Over the past month I've started building apps with AI in a day that would have taken 5-10X longer before. The goal of this post is to capture my learnings. I'll try and summarize each app at the top, share an overview of the development process, and then a running log at the bottom.



1. **Goal Journal**
2. **PDF OCD**
3. **White Paper Podcast**
4. **Investor call viewer**



The goal behind **Goal Journal** was to design a mobile app for capturing my progress on various goals. There are plenty of progress trackers out there, but I wanted something that would let me tap a record button, describe what I had done, and then use AI to transcribe and summarize it.



My wife and I scan all of the documents that we receive so that they're easier to share and find later. This might be a bit OCD (hence the name), but we've found it's a simple hack for putting PDFs in our todo list.  The problem is that when you want to find a document from a year or two ago, most of the documents are not OCR'd and the filenames are terrible. **PDF OCD** runs hourly in the background and when it finds a new PDF it OCR's and uses AI to generate a new filename with the date, company, and description of the doc.
