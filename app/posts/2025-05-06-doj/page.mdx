This post is an outline of the Atlantic's recent article [The Destruction of the DOJ](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/trump-destroying-doj/682681/). 

I hope that the outline is a bit easier to read quickly and see the big picture, but if you have the time, I highly recommend reading the original article and if you haven't already, subscribing to The Atlantic.

## I. Introduction

* **Rule of Law Foundation**

  * Thomas Paine famously asked what made America different from England—“In America, the law is king.”
  * Over decades, the DOJ came to embody that ideal as the federal guardian of apolitical, professional law enforcement.&#x20;
* **Significance of Trump’s Debasement**

  * By politicizing the DOJ, Trump assaults the very rule-of-law principle, replacing “law as king” with personal prerogative.&#x20;

## II. The Threefold Assault on the DOJ

### A. Punishing Political Opponents

1. **Erosion of DOJ Independence**

   * Once the bulwark against politicized prosecutions, the DOJ now bends investigations to the president’s will—contrary to norms since Robert Jackson’s 1940 warning against targeting “persons whom \[a prosecutor] dislikes.”&#x20;
2. **Executive Order Against Former Employees**

   * An April 2025 order directs the DOJ to probe Chris Krebs (ex-CISA director) and Miles Taylor (former DHS official) for “perceived disloyalty,” after they publicly debunked election-fraud claims—forcing Krebs to resign from SentinelOne and exposing both to possible imprisonment.&#x20;
3. **State-Level Coercion**

   * Trump’s hand-picked U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba, launched a criminal inquiry into Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration for “obstruction” of federal deportation priorities—subpoenaing state officials over routine ICE detainers.&#x20;
4. **Pam Bondi’s Culture-War Suits**

   * AG Bondi sued Maine for refusing to ban transgender athletes from girls’ sports, probed the L.A. Sheriff’s Office for alleged anti-Second Amendment bias and “lengthy” gun-permit delays, and revoked DOJ protections shielding journalists from leak-investigation subpoenas.&#x20;
5. **Interim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin’s Overreach**

   * **EPA-Grantee Fraud Probe**: Pressured the FBI to investigate Biden-era EPA grant recipients on flimsy fraud allegations—so weak a senior aide resigned rather than advance them in court.
   * **Schumer & Co.**: Threatened or opened probes of Georgetown University, Sen. Charles Schumer, and Reps. Eugene Vindman and Robert Garcia—clear intimidation of political adversaries.
   * **“Competing Viewpoints” Letters**: Sent inquiry letters to leading medical journals demanding evidence of balanced opinions, implying content discrimination if they refused.
   * **DOGE at USIP**: Threatened criminal charges and dispatched D.C. police to force entry of “DOGE” into the U.S. Institute of Peace.&#x20;
6. **Selective Fundraising Probe**

   * A presidential memorandum orders the DOJ to investigate ActBlue (Democratic platform) for “straw” or foreign contributions—while ignoring WinRed, despite WinRed receiving seven times as many FTC complaints.&#x20;

### B. Rewarding Allies

1. **Mass Pardons and Commutations**

   * On Day 1, Trump pardoned or commuted nearly all Jan 6 rioters—including Stewart Rhodes and Enrique Tarrio—undermining accountability for the insurrection.&#x20;
2. **Political Quid Pro Quo**

   * Dismissed corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams on transparently pretextual grounds; prosecutors resigned en masse after a federal judge condemned the move as a political favor.&#x20;
3. **Crypto Industry Favors**

   * Disbanded the DOJ’s cryptocurrency-fraud unit, reassigning career prosecutors away from money-laundering cases, and commuted the sentence of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht—“fan service for the crypto bros.”&#x20;
4. **Law-Enforcement Union Support**

   * Deleted the national police-misconduct database; froze all pending consent decrees (e.g., Minneapolis, Chicago); publicly pledged the Fraternal Order of Police no new pattern-or-practice investigations would proceed.&#x20;
5. **Selective Resource Shifts**

   * Cut FBI domestic-terrorism staffing amid rising right-wing militia threats; launched an “anti-Tesla” task force in praise of Elon Musk supporters; repurposed the Civil-Rights Division under Harmeet Dhillon toward culture-war cases (transgender athletes, alleged K–12 liberal “indoctrination”).&#x20;
6. **Trivial Patronage & Corporate Benefits**

   * Fast-tracked actor Mel Gibson’s firearm-rights restoration despite a domestic-violence conviction; pardoned major campaign donors like Paul Walczak; split the Tax Division into civil and criminal arms and paused Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prosecutions—delaying or dismissing at least five corporate bribery cases.&#x20;

---

### C. Eliminating Internal Opposition

1. **Pardon Attorney Ouster**

   * Fired Elizabeth G. Oyer after she refused to recommend Mel Gibson’s gun-rights restoration, crippling the impartial pardon-vetting office.&#x20;
2. **Oversight Office Shake-Up**

   * Removed the FOIA Office director and placed the head of the Office of Professional Responsibility (ethics watchdog) on indefinite leave, silencing external and internal oversight.&#x20;
3. **Widespread Career-Staff Purges**

   * Let go a dozen-plus career prosecutors from Trump-related investigations; relieved the immigration attorney who exposed the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.&#x20;
4. **FBI Leadership & Division Reassignments**

   * Forced out six senior Biden-era FBI executives; reassigned or retired top ethics, national-security, criminal, and environment-division lawyers; slashed staffing at the Public Integrity Section.&#x20;
5. **Undermining Key Legal Offices**

   * Left the Office of Legal Counsel leaderless and sidelined on executive orders; the Solicitor General’s office is hemorrhaging its top Supreme Court litigators.&#x20;
6. **Chilling Department Culture**

   * Hallways fell silent as attorneys avoided open-plan conversations; meetings ended in tears, and junior lawyers self-censored under fear of reassignment—or worse.&#x20;

---

## III. Broader Implications for the Rule of Law

* **Dual Role of Rule of Law**

  * Government self-restraint ↔ public trust and individual freedom; without it, power becomes arbitrary.&#x20;
* **Culture of Fear & Self-Censorship**

  * Senators like Lisa Murkowski admit they’re “very anxious” to speak out, fearing real retaliation.&#x20;
* **Contagion Across Agencies**

  * The DOJ now aids DHS in evading court orders; a federal judge found probable criminal contempt in immigrant-flight cases, and Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s forced removal risks further contempt.&#x20;
* **Direct Defiance of Laws & Orders**

  * Ignored Congress’s anti-TikTok law and flouted a district-court order to readmit the Associated Press into the Oval Office.&#x20;
