I've recently been taken aback by the many stories of individuals swept up in the recent wave of deportations.

To help myself better understand these indivdual stories and see the big picture, I went to chatGPT and asked it to build a [report][1] with Deep Research. 

I'm sharing it here as well, in case it might help others as well and so that it does not get lost in time as the story inevitably moves on.
