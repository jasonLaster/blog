After a decade as a happy Jekyll user, last year I finally made the jump and migrated my blog to NextJS. [Dmitry](https://x.com/blvdmitry), of Reshaped fame, had made a NextJS template that was inspired by Brian Lovin's [site](https://x.com/blvdmitry/status/1758498848203268455) and I was excited to adopt both a modern stack and design ([post](/2024-02-19-migrating-to-next)).

After a year, some of the cracks were beginning to show. The most important was page load time. Pages could take take a couple of seconds to load because they were server rendered and not staticly built.

There were also some small details:

- When you tried to load the dark theme during the day, you'd see the light theme flash. Worse, if you set the light theme at night, you'd see the dark theme flash.

* Because the layout had two sidebars, the content was never centered unless you entered a reader mode which added an additional click.
* The site used `MDXRemote` and rendered the markdown on demand which added complexity.

While none of these issues were insurmountable, it felt like it would be easier to make the jump to Next 15 and adopt first class MDX support.

There was also the added benefit of being able to borrow ideas from [Lee Robinson](https://x.com/leeerob), Vercel's head of product, and [Guillermo Rauch](https://x.com/rauchg), Vercel's CEO, who both had modern setups ([1](https://github.com/leerob/site), [2](http://github.com/rauchg/blog/)). And Lee also published a great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34bRv6cQezo) last November.

**Here are some of the lessons**

### Adding a post header

On the surface, Guillermo and Lee have similar setups. They both use `@next/mdx` which makes it really easy to add `mdx` pages.

```next.config.ts
import createMDX from "@next/mdx";

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  pageExtensions: ["md", "mdx", "ts", "tsx"],
  experimental: {},
};

const withMDX = createMDX({});
export default withMDX(nextConfig);
```

Because Lee just shows the post's title, he's able to include in the markdown and move on. Because, Guillermo includes the date the post was published and view count, he needs to fetch the data separately.

At the most simple level, he does what you'd expect and fetches the post details and page count from an API endpoint which queries redis on page load. Because this is async and would cause a page flash, he also keeps a static list of posts which he uses during the server render and static build phase.

This is fine, and it may just by my OCD speaking, but I find having to keep the JSON file in sync, a bit ugly. Sure, you could add a watch command to build the JSON file in the background, but simply maintaining an extra artifact in your repo feels wrong.

```bash
"concurrently \"next dev --turbopack\" \"bun run watch-posts\"",`
```

The work around, is to have the post's `layout` component fetch the posts and pass them down to the Header component.

```app/layout.tsx
export default async function BlogLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  const posts = await getBlogPosts();
  return (
    <div>
      <Header posts={posts} />
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This is almost exactly what you want, but it still has one disadvantage. Because we're passing all of the posts down to client, just to find the one that matches the current post's slug, we're sending far more data to the client than is needed.

```tsx
export default function Header({ posts }: { posts: PostWithoutContent[] }) {
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const post = posts.find((p) => pathname.endsWith(p.slug));
  return <h1>{post.title} (post.date)</h1>;
}
```

While this is not worse than what we were doing before with the `posts.json` file, it is unfortunate because it feels like something that should be handled in the server component and thus avoidable.

The rationale is that by not including path information, the server component, is able to preserve state across navigations, which is nice, but does have this one downside.

### Should metadata be Yaml or JS?

MDX became popular because it lets you import your own components and Next components like `Image` . It also lets you export constants like `metadata` which works similar to page metadata.

```js
export const metadata = {
  title: "Understanding AI",
  description: "A brief overview on neural networks and language models.",
  alternates: {
    canonical: "/n/ai",
  },
  openGraph: {
    title: "Understanding AI",
    description: "A brief overview on neural networks and language models.",
    images: [{ url: "/og/7-principles-of-rich-web-applications" }],
  },
};
```

This is a nice improvement over the classical frontmatter approach where you're including YAML at the top of the post which is how one of Vercel's [demo blogs](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog) handles it.

```yaml
---
title: Understanding AI
description: A brief overview on neural networks and language models.
---
```

The one downside is being able to easily collect the post metadata for the sitemap and posts list. The demo site collects the metadata by reading the files and parsing the YAML which is not too hard since the format is simple, but somewhat ugly.

```js
function parseFrontmatter(fileContent: string) {
  let frontmatterRegex = /---\s*([\s\S]*?)\s*---/
  let match = frontmatterRegex.exec(fileContent)
  let frontMatterBlock = match![1]
  let content = fileContent.replace(frontmatterRegex, '').trim()
  let frontMatterLines = frontMatterBlock.trim().split('\n')
  let metadata: Partial<Metadata> = {}

  frontMatterLines.forEach((line) => {
    let [key, ...valueArr] = line.split(': ')
    let value = valueArr.join(': ').trim()
    value = value.replace(/^['"](.*)['"]$/, '$1') // Remove quotes
    metadata[key.trim() as keyof Metadata] = value
  })

  return { metadata: metadata as Metadata, content }
}

function getMDXData(dir) {
  let mdxFiles = getMDXFiles(dir)
  return mdxFiles.map((file) => {
    let { metadata, content } = readMDXFile(path.join(dir, file))
    let slug = path.basename(file, path.extname(file))

    return {
      metadata,
      slug,
      content,
    }
  })
}

```

On the surface, this should be an advantage of the module approach because you should be able to import the metadata as if it were a module.

```js
async function importMetadata(filePath: string): Promise<Metadata> {
  try {
    const importPath = filePath
      .replace(/\\/g, "/")
      .replace(/^.*?blog\/src\//, "@/")
      .replace(/\.mdx$/, "");

    const { metadata } = await import(importPath);
    return standardizeMetadata(metadata);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Error importing metadata from ${filePath} ${error}`);
  }
}
```

I think this approach should work, but I had some issues at build time and in reality who has the time to debug module reconciliation! I ended up going with an uglier version which uses a regex to pull out the metadata and then uses an eval to `JSON.stringify` and parse it.

```js
export function extractMetadata(filePath: string): Metadata {
  const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, "utf-8");
  const metadataMatch = content.match(/export const metadata = ({[\s\S]*?});/);

  if (!metadataMatch[1]) {
    throw new Error(`Could not import metadata from ${filePath}`);
  }

  try {
    // Use eval in a safer way by executing in a controlled scope
    const evalFn = new Function(`
      try {
        const metadata = ${metadataMatch[1]};
        return JSON.stringify(metadata);
      } catch (e) {
        return '{"error": "Failed to evaluate metadata: " + e.message}';
      }
    `);

    const jsonStr = evalFn();
    const metadata = JSON.parse(jsonStr);
    return standardizeMetadata(metadata);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Could not import metadata from ${filePath}`);
  }
}
```

This is totally silly and is probably an area where `@next/mdx` could export a `getPostsMetadata` function that takes care of this for you.

### Updating the layout

The previous layout was inspired by [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/)'s terrific blog and features a left sidebar and the ability to easily scroll through the posts.

<div className="flex relative h-[400px]">
  <div className="flex flex-row gap-8 translate-x-[-205px] scroll-x h-[400px]  absolute">
    <Image
      src={BlogPost}
      alt="Blog Post"
      className="h-auto border-1 border-gray-200 rounded-lg"
    />
    <Image
      src={LandingPage}
      alt="Landing Page"
      className="h-auto border-1 border-gray-200 rounded-lg"
    />
  </div>
</div>

While these are nice touches, this time around I wanted to focus on simplicity and give users a zen mode reading experience without having to select reader mode.

### AI played copy writer

While I was migrating the posts from the old YAML frontmatter format to the new MDX metadata, I asked Cursor to help me out.

Cursor found all of the posts and eagerly went to work updating each of them. A couple of hours later, I realized that in addition to updating the format of the metadata, it also played copy writer and updated many of the page titles!

### Supporting theme toggling

One of my top frustrations with the old site was that the wrong theme would often flash in from the server side render.

The new site lifts Guillermo's terrific `ThemeToggle` button and `theme-effect` which includes several nice details.

- The theme toggle button is a tri-state where the third mode is system.
- The theme ties into Tailwind via it's darkMode `class` mode.
- There's a `themeEffect` function which is run synchronously at page load even before the stylesheet has loaded and React has mounted.
- `themeEffect` will read the pref from localStorage and pause transitions while the theme is being applied.

With that said, I shoud confess that even though i was lifting the implementation, it was still pretty difficult to setup because the latest version's of NextJS use Tailwind v4 and Guillermo's site uses v3. After quite a bit of debugging, I learned that in V4 `tailwind.config.js` is not read by default and needs to be registered via a `config` command. There are also some other slight differences like the tailwind utilities are replaced with a single import.

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@config "../../tailwind.config.js";
```

### Slugifying headers

Another nice benefit of upgrading, was that Vercel's [demo site](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog) included a slugified header component that shows `#` on hover and makes it easy to share your current position.

This is a feature I was hoping to add, but it feels even better to borrow and extend.

```js
function slugify(str) {
  return str
    .toString()
    .toLowerCase()
    .trim() // Remove whitespace from both ends of a string
    .replace(/\s+/g, "-") // Replace spaces with -
    .replace(/&/g, "-and-") // Replace & with 'and'
    .replace(/[^\w\-]+/g, "") // Remove all non-word characters except for -
    .replace(/\-\-+/g, "-"); // Replace multiple - with single -
}

function createHeading(level) {
  const Heading = ({ children }) => {
    const slug = slugify(children);
    return React.createElement(
      `h${level}`,
      {
        id: slug,
        className: `group flex whitespace-pre-wrap text-gray-800 dark:text-zinc-200 font-medium mt-8 mb-3 ${
          level === 1 ? "font-medium pt-12" : ""
        }`,
      },
      <>
        <a
          href={`#${slug}`}
          key={`link-${slug}`}
          className="opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 group-focus:opacity-100 ml-[-20px] pr-[4px] text-gray-600 dark:text-zinc-500 hover:text-gray-800 dark:hover:text-zinc-300"
        >
          #
        </a>
        {children}
      </>
    );
  };

  Heading.displayName = `Heading${level}`;

```

### Syntax highlighting code blocks

Initially I went with `sugar-high` because both Lee and Guillermo were using and I liked how light weight it was and how easy it was to add to `mdx-components`.

```ts
code: ({ children, ...props }: ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"code">) => {
   const codeHTML = highlight(children as string);
   return <code dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: codeHTML }} {...props} />;
},
```

After adding it, I ran into a couple of issues

- I was not sure how to find nice light and dark themes
- Setting the themes in the css for all three states (system, light, and dark) was surprisingly difficult
- Styling inline-blocks separately from code blocks had some edge cases
- It was not obvious how I'd add file tabs which is nice for showing the filename associated with the code

After messing around for a couple of minutes, I decided to go with [Bright](https://bright.codehike.org/) which handled these cases fairly well and played nicely with `next/mdx`

```mdx-components.tsx
Code.theme = {
  dark: "github-dark",
  light: "github-light",
  darkSelector: "html.dark",
  lightSelector: "html:not(.dark)",
};

const components = {
  pre: Code
}
```

### Adding a dynamic OG Image

NextJS makes it fairly easy to add dynamic OG images. I started with this [example](https://vercel.com/guides/dynamic-text-as-image) and then updated the export function to `export function GET(request: NextRequest) {` to support Next 15 and asked Cursor to update the look and feel and it got it right in one shot.

<Image src={MyOGImage} alt="og-image" />

I haven't tested this yet, but I believe that I should be able to register the image by adding the `openGraph` metadata.

```page.mdx
export const metadata = {
  title: "Migrating to Next.js 15",
  description:
    "Some of the lessons I learned adding post metadata, theme support, and syntax highlighting",
  date: "2025-03-24",
  categories: ["JS"],
  openGraph: {
    title: "Migrating to Next.js 15",
    description:
      "Some of the lessons I learned adding post metadata, theme support, and syntax highlighting",
    images: [{ url: "/og/?title=Migrating to Next.js 15" }],
  },
};
```

There's obviously a decent amount of duplication here, so you can clean it up by adding a helper function.

```page.mdx
import { postMetadata } from "../../utils/metadata";

export const metadata = postMetadata({
  title: "Migrating to Next.js 15",
  description:
    "Some of the lessons I learned adding post metadata, theme support, and syntax highlighting",
  date: "2025-03-24",
  categories: ["JS"],
})
```

```utils/metadata.ts
export const postMetadata = (post: Post) => {
  return {
    ...post,
    openGraph: {
      title: post.title,
      description: post.description,
      images: [{ url: `/og/?title=${post.title}` }],
    },
  };
};
```
