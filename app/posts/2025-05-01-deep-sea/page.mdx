The NY Times has been a great job of covering the Trump administration's recent reversal on deep sea mining and specifically **The Metals Company** ([1][1], [2][2], [3][3], [4][4]).

This begs the question, how does deep sea mining approaches today compare to the technology we had in the 1970s. 

This post was drafted by chatGPT Deep Research and covers topics such as:

- A comparison between '70s and today
- A deep dive on modern approaches 
- A review of environmental concerns
- How deep-sea mining compares to deep-sea drilling 


One of the lessons I took away from the post is that the timescale in the deep sea is approximately 100 to 1, which means one year on land is the equivelant to a hundred years in the deap sea.


> * A **4.5-year brooding octopus** is the deep-sea equivalent of a land bird sitting on its nest for **half a human lifetime**.
> * **Mining disturbance tracks** from 1979 are still visible and ecologically impactful **44 years later**, while a forest clear-cut on land might show strong regrowth in 10–20 years.
> * **Nodules take millions of years** to form—roughly **1 cm per million years**. That’s like waiting an entire human civilization timeline to grow a single marble.
> 
> So if a field left fallow on land might regrow grasses in a year, the deep-sea equivalent would take a **century**—or never, if hard substrates (nodules) were removed. You can think of the deep ocean like a **library of time**, where each “book” takes a geological age to write.

It pays to be careful because any damage done in our lifetime will be passed down to our children.
