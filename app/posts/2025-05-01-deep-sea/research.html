    <p data-start="154" data-end="1501">In the 1970s, deep-sea mining was a wild new idea with very rudimentary technology.

The 1970s mining gear was <strong data-start="1244" data-end="1272">disruptive and imprecise</strong> – like dragging a heavy rake or dredge over the seabed, gathering everything in its path.

    <p data-start="16916" data-end="17745">All these potential impacts have led to significant pushback against deep-sea mining from scientists, conservation organizations, and even some governments. <strong data-start="17073" data-end="17113">Marine biologists and oceanographers</strong> repeatedly emphasize that we still know very little about deep-sea ecosystems – and that caution is warranted.

In 2021, over 600 scientists signed an open letter calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until more research is done. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and groups like WWF have echoed these calls, essentially urging a <strong data-start="17674" data-end="17685">“pause”</strong> before humanity rushes to industrialize the ocean’s depths.</p>
    <p data-start="17747" data-end="18789">Environmental NGOs argue that deep-sea mining could cause <strong data-start="17805" data-end="17828">irreversible damage</strong> to a realm that until now has been relatively untouched. They point out that once species or habitats are gone, you can’t replace them – no one is going to “replant” a slow-growing sponge garden 4 km underwater. Moreover, there’s an ethical argument: the deep sea is considered the <strong data-start="18111" data-end="18141">common heritage of mankind</strong> under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, so its exploitation should be extremely carefully managed, if allowed at all. <em data-start="18267" data-end="18336">“We have to stop a new environmental catastrophe before it begins,”</em> said one member of the European Parliament in 2023, warning that if reckless deep-sea mining launches, it could go down in history as <em data-start="18471" data-end="18506">“the destruction of the deep sea”</em><span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.sciencenorway.no/business-climate-policy-mineralogy/norway-strongly-criticised-in-nature-editorial-for-approving-seabed-mining/2317159#:~:text=for%20seabed%20minerals%2C%20according%20to,the%20Norwegian%20Broadcast%20Corporation%20NRK" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">sciencenorway.no</span></span></span></a></span>.

    <p data-start="18791" data-end="19735">Specific objections raised include: the lack of comprehensive long-term impact studies, the difficulty in monitoring such remote operations, and the question of whether we truly need these minerals from the sea or could obtain them through better recycling and land-based mining improvements. There’s also concern about the governance by the ISA – a relatively small, Jamaica-based body that some fear might be influenced by industry interests and may not effectively enforce environmental safeguards on the high seas. In July 2023, the ISA faced intense pressure at its meeting, and Nature reported the looming decision on mining as <em data-start="19425" data-end="19443">“how bad is it?”</em> with emerging data hinting at long-term damage even from small-scale tests<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02290-5#:~:text=Deep,%E2%80%94%20how%20bad%20is%20it" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">nature.com</span></span></span></a></span>.

    <p data-start="19737" data-end="20809">On the other side, the mining companies (and the nations sponsoring them) argue that deep-sea mining can be done responsibly and that the metals are essential for green technologies (batteries for electric cars, etc.). The Metals Company, for instance, often claims that obtaining battery metals from nodules will do <strong data-start="20054" data-end="20075">less overall harm</strong> than traditional mining on land (which can involve deforestation, child labor, toxic tailings, etc.). They also highlight that no communities live in the deep ocean, whereas land mines often impact local communities and Indigenous peoples. This has led to a contentious debate: a choice between potential deep-sea ecosystem damage and the demands of the clean energy transition. Environmental groups are essentially saying, “Not so fast – we need to make sure we’re not solving one problem by creating another.” As of now (2025), no commercial deep-sea mining has begun in international waters, partly due to this pressure delaying regulations. The coming years will be critical in determining if and how this industry moves forward.</p>
    <h2 data-start="20811" data-end="20886">Deep-Sea Mining vs. Deep-Sea Drilling: Different Risks in the Deep Ocean</h2>
    <p data-start="20888" data-end="21109">It’s worth comparing deep-sea mining to another well-known seafloor activity: <strong data-start="20966" data-end="20991">deep-sea oil drilling</strong>. Both involve heavy industrial equipment operating in the ocean’s depths, but their risk profiles and impacts differ:</p>
    <ul data-start="21111" data-end="24600">
    <li data-start="21111" data-end="22182">
    <p data-start="21113" data-end="22182"><strong data-start="21113" data-end="21160">Catastrophic Spill vs. Chronic Disturbance:</strong> The biggest fear with deep-sea drilling (for oil) is a blowout or spill – as tragically seen in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, where ~4 million barrels of oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico over 87 days<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/deepwater-horizon-bp-gulf-america-oil-spill#:~:text=On%20April%2020%2C%202010%2C%20the,be%20responsible%20for%20the%20spill" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">epa.gov</span></span></span></a></span>. That kind of event can spread pollution over huge areas, coating shorelines and killing marine life en masse. Deep-sea mining doesn’t carry a risk of oil spills, since it’s not dealing with hydrocarbons under pressure. In that sense, mining is <strong data-start="21654" data-end="21711">less likely to cause a sudden large-scale catastrophe</strong>. However, mining causes a more distributed, long-term impact: scraping hundreds of square kilometers of seafloor and creating sediment plumes. It’s a <strong data-start="21862" data-end="21896">widespread habitat destruction</strong> that, while not as acutely dramatic as an oil spill, could have long-lasting effects concentrated in the deep ocean. Drilling accidents are rare but disastrous; mining damage is certain and continuous over the operation area, even if no single event is “disastrous” in the spill sense.</p>
    </li>
    <li data-start="22184" data-end="22874">
    <p data-start="22186" data-end="22874"><strong data-start="22186" data-end="22200">Pollution:</strong> Oil drilling (even without spills) can introduce drilling muds, chemicals, and small oil leaks into the environment, and if a well strikes oil, a failure means toxic crude release. Mining will introduce noise and possibly some heavy metal disturbance, but it’s mostly a physical impact (rocks and mud) rather than chemical pollution. There is concern that mining could release toxic elements from sediments (for example, if deep sediments contain mercury or other elements that get re-suspended), but this is less understood. In general, <strong data-start="22739" data-end="22781">oil is poisonous to many forms of life</strong>, whereas seafloor sediment is not toxic per se – it’s the blanketing effect that is harmful.</p>
    </li>
    <li data-start="22876" data-end="23631">
    <p data-start="22878" data-end="23631"><strong data-start="22878" data-end="22897">Affected Areas:</strong> Drilling impacts tend to be <strong data-start="22926" data-end="22939">localized</strong> around the drill site (barring a spill). A single well has a footprint of maybe tens of meters, plus some area affected by discharged drill cuttings. Mining, by design, will impact <strong data-start="23121" data-end="23167">hundreds to thousands of square kilometers</strong> if an operation runs for years. For example, a commercial nodule mining operation might plan to collect millions of tons of nodules, meaning essentially <strong data-start="23321" data-end="23359">raking clean vast swaths of seabed</strong>. So the spatial scale of routine impact is much larger for mining. Drilling’s worst-case scenario (a spill) can spread damage far and wide including surface waters and coasts, whereas mining’s damage is mostly in the deep and doesn’t directly touch the surface or coasts.</p>
    </li>
    <li data-start="23633" data-end="24600">
    <p data-start="23635" data-end="24600"><strong data-start="23635" data-end="23663">Recovery and Visibility:</strong> After an oil well is drilled and finished (assuming no accident), the seafloor might recover relatively quickly – a few years for the benthic life to re-establish around the abandoned wellhead, since the physical structure is still there (and often becomes an artificial reef). But after mining, the seabed is stripped of the structures (nodules) and many animals. As we noted, recovery could be <strong data-start="24060" data-end="24094">extremely slow in the deep sea</strong>, potentially centuries or never to regain original conditions<span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/news/2025/deep-sea-mining-for-rare-metals-impacts-marine-life-for-decades-scientists-say#:~:text=A%20study%20published%20in%20the,undisturbed%20sites%2044%20years%20later" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">hw.ac.uk</span></span></span></a></span>. Also, oil spills are very <em data-start="24223" data-end="24232">visible</em> (images of oil-soaked birds, etc., galvanize public outcry), whereas damage a few kilometers under the ocean is out of sight and harder for the public to grasp. This difference means there’s a risk that mining impacts could be underappreciated simply because they’re not readily seen – until scientists go down to look years later and find an eerie underwater desert.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-start="24602" data-end="25092">In summary, <strong data-start="24614" data-end="24635">deep-sea drilling</strong> is like a high-risk, high-consequence gamble (most days okay, one day very bad), while <strong data-start="24723" data-end="24742">deep-sea mining</strong> is a steady pressure with guaranteed disruption but perhaps no single “oh no” moment. Both industries need strong regulation: drilling taught us through disasters like Deepwater Horizon how bad things can get without proper safety, and mining is now teaching us (through test results) how significant the cumulative effects might be on ocean health.</p>
    <h2 data-start="25094" data-end="25147">Conclusion: Balancing Curiosity, Need, and Caution</h2>
    <p data-start="25149" data-end="25760">The story of deep-sea mining, from the freewheeling experiments of the 1970s to the sophisticated robot miners of today, is a testament to human ingenuity – and a reminder of our responsibility. The deep ocean is Earth’s last frontier, a place of alien creatures and ancient resources, slow-growing corals and brooding octopus mothers. It took billions of years for those ecosystems to evolve and millions of years to accumulate those mineral treasures on the seabed. The question we face now is: <strong data-start="25646" data-end="25760">how do we balance our need for crucial metals with the need to protect our planet’s most untouched ecosystems?</strong></p>
    <p data-start="25762" data-end="26431">For now, the world watches as companies like The Metals Company conduct their pilot runs, and as regulatory bodies debate rules that could launch a new industry. It’s a classic scenario of exploration vs. preservation. Standing in 2025, we have more knowledge than those 1970s pioneers – we know there’s delicate life down there and that our actions have consequences – but we are also more desperate for resources to fuel a green economy. Families discussing this around the dinner table might wonder if the phones in our pockets or the electric car in the driveway will one day contain metals vacuumed from the abyssal plains. It’s an exciting and unsettling thought.</p>
    <p data-start="26433" data-end="27044">One thing is certain: any decision to begin deep-sea mining on a large scale should be made with <strong data-start="26530" data-end="26566">great caution and full awareness</strong> of what’s at stake. As one Nature article headline aptly asked, when contemplating opening this Pandora’s box: <em data-start="26678" data-end="26737">“Deep-sea mining could soon be approved — how bad is it?”</em><span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02290-5#:~:text=Deep,%E2%80%94%20how%20bad%20is%20it" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out"><span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"><span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden" style="opacity: 1; transform: none;"><span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center">nature.com</span></span></span></a></span>. The coming years will likely give us that answer. In the meantime, scientists continue to study the deep sea’s secrets – from sediment plumes to octopus brooding – hoping to guide us toward choices that won’t leave the ocean’s cradle of life irreversibly disrupted.</p>
