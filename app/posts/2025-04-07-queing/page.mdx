## With a database

Postgres has support for selecting a record and setting its status in a single transaction which protects it against write contention.

* `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` is critical for preventing two tasks from being selected by seperate transactions.
* `WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM next_task)` makes it easy to set one or many tasks to `in_progress` in the transaction`
* `RETURNING *` returns the full task record for the transaction

<Tabs>

```js
// title SELECT_TASK.sql
BEGIN;

-- Select and lock a pending task, skipping those already locked
WITH next_task AS (
  SELECT id FROM tasks
  WHERE status = 'pending'
  FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
  LIMIT 1
)

-- Set its status to 'in_progress'
UPDATE tasks
SET status = 'in_progress'
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM next_task)
RETURNING *;

COMMIT;
```

```js 
// title getNextTask.js 

import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool();

async function getAndClaimTask() {
  const client = await pool.connect();
  try {
    await client.query('BEGIN');

    const { rows } = await client.query(`
      WITH next_task AS (
        SELECT id FROM tasks
        WHERE status = 'pending'
        FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
        LIMIT 1
      )
      UPDATE tasks
      SET status = 'in_progress'
      WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM next_task)
      RETURNING *;
    `);

    await client.query('COMMIT');
    return rows[0] || null;
  } catch (err) {
    await client.query('ROLLBACK');
    throw err;
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}
```

```js 
// title schema.sql 

CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  data TEXT,
  status TEXT -- e.g., 'pending', 'in_progress', 'done'
);
```

</Tabs>

## Queing libraries

There are several libraries like [graphile-worker][1] and [pg-boss][2] that wrap the `SKIP LOCKED` approach and provide some useful primitives like concurrency limits. 


```js 
import { run, Worker } from 'graphile-worker';

run({
  concurrency: 5,
  taskList: {
    send_email: async (payload) => {
      // send email using payload
    },
  },
});
```


## Other approaches

* In memory 
* In SQS or another dedicated queue
