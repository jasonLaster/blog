The U.S. stock market has undergone a dramatic transformation from 2000 to 2024, both in size and composition. Starting at $9.36T in 2000, the market cap has grown nearly 6-fold to $52.64T, while experiencing significant volatility during the dot-com crash (-$2.61T in 2002), financial crisis (-$4.52T in 2008), and post-COVID tech correction (-$8.01T in 2022). The concentration of power among the top 10 companies has followed a U-shaped pattern: starting high at 41.60% during the dot-com bubble, dropping to a low of 16.64% in 2014, and rising again to 37.11% in 2024.

The composition shift has been equally dramatic. In 2000, the market was dominated by financial (AIG, Citigroup), industrial (GE), and telecom (AT&T) companies, with Microsoft as the sole tech representative. By 2024, the market is overwhelmingly controlled by tech giants, with the "Magnificent Seven" (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta, Alphabet, Tesla) leading the charge, primarily driven by AI and digital transformation. 

This shift reflects three major economic transitions: from physical to digital business models, from regional to global platforms, and from traditional valuation metrics to growth and AI potential. Only Microsoft has remained in the top 10 throughout this entire period, highlighting the massive turnover in corporate leadership as technology has reshaped the economy.
