Seaching in a document _cmd+f_ has been a surprisingly hard feature to get right in the Debugger.
On the surface, it seems like it should be simple, but there are a lot of subtle interactions
that make it difficult to get right. Here is a quick spec that helped me document the feature.

#### Queries

- **typing/deleting query**
  - should search after each character, index
  - the index and count should be correct
  - the match should be to right of the cursor

#### Iterating

- **(enter/shift enter | cmd+g/cmd+shift+g)**
  - increments and decrements by one
  - wraps from first to last of the list and vice versa
- **moving the cursor**
  - updates the match and index to be to the right of the cursor

#### Mouse Actions

- **click on document**
  - **cmd+g** should research from that location.
  - **cmd+f** should refocus the search bar with the current query
  - **search bar** should search from the cursor location
- **select text**
  - **cmd+f** should update the query of the search bar
  - **cmd+g** should search from that location with the current query
