This post walks through where the clean energy industry is today and how the passage of the budget bill will inevitably set the industry back and cause the US to lose the AI race and leave the next generation an uninhabitable earth. 


## Clean energy today

Over the past decade, clean energy and solar in particular, have become cheaper and more consequential.

* Solar panels are 98% cheaper today than in 2004, and are now so cheap that in some cases it's cheaper to build a fence with solar than wood ([tweet][13]).
* 26% of Texas's electricity comes from solar ([tweet][3]).
* All net-new generation in Texas over the last decade has come from wind and solar ([tweet][5]). 
* China's solar generation in April was larger than total electricty demand of all but two countries ([tweet][9])!

## The big beautiful bill

Infuriatingly the republican's budget bill threatens to kneecap the clean energy industry.


* Chris Wright, the secretary of energy, argued that because solar and wind are variable their subsidies are wasteful ([post][1]).  
* The bill could wipe out ~500GW of potential new clean energy production by phasing out existing credits and imposing new taxes ([tweet][2]).
* In addition to taxing solar after 2027, they'll be a new direct subsidy for coal ([tweet][3]).
* If the bill passes, they'll be 40% less US residential solar in five years ([tweet][7]).


## Solar's rise in China

The contrast with China could not be clearer

* China has added 3,500 TWh of solar generation over the past decade. The US has added 1,600 TWh of solar generation over the past 15 years ([tweet][8]). 
* China's solar generation is the equivelant of 437 GW nuclear reactors running at 90% capacity ([tweet][8]). 
* In China, 60% of the new Q1'25 solar capacity came from rooftop solar ([tweet][6]). 
* In contrast US residential solar companies like Sunnova are filing for bankruptcy under the weight of insane tariffs ([tweet][12]). 



## AI Race 

Today, it's looking like energy generation is the most likely bottleneck in the AI race.

* China's electricity generation has gone from 1,500 TWh in 2,000 to 10,000 TWh today while US generation has remained flat at 4,000 TWh ([tweet](10)). 
* China added 244 GW of renewable energy capacity this year. The US added 12 GW ([tweet](11))
* Nuclear energy startups like Oklo and NuScale hang in the balance. Despite Trump paying lip service through executive orders, BBB threatens to drastically cut the Loan Program Office which is essential for financing new plants ([post][14]).

## Climate impact

It's hard to under state the impact on climate.

* The recent heat wave is "breaking" America ([essay][15])
* This is the first time a Canadian fire has survived two winters ([tweet][16])
* The Atlantic recently published the alarming post titled "America's coming smoke epidemic" which highlights research that connects the dots between wildfire exposure and long term lung function ([article][17]).

## My observations 

At a high level, I think it's reasonable to conclude that

1. Clean energy has become incredibly cheap and easy to deploy at scale 
2. Republicans are continuing to cynically prop up fossil fuels 

We will neither be able to win the AI race or meet any reasonable climate goal, if we're not able to scale clean energy solutions.
