**Description**:

You’re given two strings start and target consisting of lowercase English letters. You are also given a list of valid “intermediate” strings called wordList. Each move allows you to change exactly one character in the current string, and the result must be a string that exists in the wordList or be equal to the target.

Write a function to determine the minimum number of moves required to transform start into target. If it’s not possible, return -1.

Each transformation must be one character at a time, and each intermediate string must be in the wordList or the final target.


```ts 
function minTransformationSteps(start: string, target: string, wordList: string[]): number
```

**Output** 
```
minTransformationSteps("hit", "cog", ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log", "cog"])
// Output: 4
// Explanation: hit → hot → dot → dog → cog
```



**Notes**

Before really thinking about the problem, created a scratch pad where I could walk through the steps the algorithm would need to go through.


```
hit *
- cit
- hot *
  - cot
  - hog *
    - cog
- hig 
```

This step helped me calm down and feel like I had this, even though i had a strong intuition i'd need to implement a recursive function and i didn't see how it'd look yet.

Once that was done, i wanted to turn my intuition into steps, so cam up with this representation

```
[(cit, 1), (hot,1), (hig,1)] # generate candidates
(cit) [(hot,1), (hig,1)] # rule out cit because it's not on the list
(hot) [(cot,2), (hog,2), (hig,1)] # add cot and hog to the list
(cot) [(hog,2), (hig,1)] # rule out cot because it's not on the list 
(hog) [(cog,3), (hig,1)] # add cog to the list 
(cog) [(hig,1)] # :tada: it's what we wanted all along
```


At this point, i felt pretty confient just sitting down and writing the thing. At one point we needed a small helper function which was fine to split out as well, but in this case I chose to finish sketching out the program before debugging any one part of it.

I think the reason was that I was most concerned about getting my weird step-by-step algorithm represented and figured we could fix the bugs afterwards.

Here are some of the issues I ran into

1. Initially, i only transformed words with the target chars in mind. This meant that i missed some of the intermediate words that i needed to use.
2. I had loops that let me go back to prior versions. This was fixed by saving the prior states and rejecting them.


**Learnings**
* When I was debugging, I found it helpful to exit the loop after N runs. This kept things simple.
* I was surprised to see that the final solution did not need to be recursive.

// title transform.ts 

function transformWord(start: string, n: number, m: number) {
  const update = `${start}`.split("");
  update[n] = `abcdefghijklmopqrstuvwyxz`.split("")[m];
  return update.join("");
}

function minTransformationSteps(
  start: string,
  target: string,
  wordList: string[]
): number {
  const candidates: Candidate[] = [];
  let candidate: Candidate | void = { word: start, numTransforms: 0 };
  const priorAttempts: Set<string> = new Set();

  while (candidate) {
    for (let n = 0; n < candidate.word.length; n++) {
      for (let m = 0; m < 25; m++) {
        const newCandidate = transformWord(candidate.word, n, m);

        if (newCandidate == target) {
          return candidate.numTransforms + 1;
        }

        if (
          wordList.includes(newCandidate) &&
          !priorAttempts.has(newCandidate)
        ) {
          candidates.push({
            word: newCandidate,
            numTransforms: candidate.numTransforms + 1,
          });
        }

        priorAttempts.add(newCandidate);
      }
    }

    candidate = candidates.shift();
  }

  return -1;
}
``` 

```js 
// title stdout

{
  candidate: "hit",
  candidates: 0,

}
{
  candidate: "lot",
  candidates: 1,
}
{
  candidate: "dog",
  candidates: 1,
}

**Step 2: Add faster lookups**

As an optimization step, I was asked to come up with a faster way to see if the candidate word was in the word list.

This looked like going from a list of words `["hat", "hot", "cat", "coo"]` to a character based lookup map.

```ts
const tree = { h: {a: {t: true}, {o: {t: true}}}}
```

Coming up with the datastructure was easy, but thinking through how to populate it was hard. The insight here was remembering that I could pass a reference to the `subTree` and update it effectfully. This meant that I could actually recursively go character by character and populate the tree.


```ts 
function populateTree(tree, word: string) {
  if (word == "") {
    return;
  }

  const [char, ...chars] = word.split("");
  if (chars.length === 0) {
    tree.set(char, true);
  } else {
    if (!tree.has(char)) {
      tree.set(char, new Map());
    }
  }

  populateTree(tree.get(char), chars.join(""));
}

function buildWordListLookup(wordList) {
  const tree = new Map();

  for (const word of wordList) {
    populateTree(tree, word);
  }

  return tree;
}

function lookupWord(tree, word) {
  let subTree = tree;
  for (const char of word.split("")) {
    if (!subTree) {
      return false;
    }
    subTree = subTree.get(char);
  }

  return subTree;
}
```

After going with the recursive approach, I was curious to see how it would compare with the iterative approach.

Funny enough, I found the recursive approach a bit easier to think about because it was nicer to walk through the characters and call `populateTree` with the sub tree and remaining characters. 

This is probably a small difference though and the two were fairly simple. The bigger difference was that I had a couple of bugs with the loop where I was accidentally throwing away previous work which required slowing down and tracking the intermediate states.

function populateTree(tree, word: string) {
  if (word == "") {
    return;
  }

  const [char, ...chars] = word.split("");
  if (chars.length === 0) {
    tree.set(char, true);
  } else {
    if (!tree.has(char)) {
      tree.set(char, new Map());
    }
  }

  populateTree(tree.get(char), chars.join(""));
}
```

function populateTreeLoop(tree, word: string) {
  let subTree = tree;
  const chars = word.split("");
  for (i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
    const char = chars[i];
    if (i == chars.length - 1) {
      subTree.set(char, true);
    } else {
      if (subTree.has(char)) {
        const newtree = subTree.get(char);
        subTree = newtree;
      } else {
        const newTree = new Map();
        subTree.set(char, newTree);
        subTree = newTree;
      }
    }
