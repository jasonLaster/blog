I'm a developer and co-founder of [Replay.io](http://replay.io/).

In 2012, I attended **[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)**, started contributing to [Ruby](https://github.com/pry/pry) and [Python's](https://bpython-interpreter.org/) most popular debuggers, and learned about time-travel debugging.

After Recurse, I joined **Etsy**, became a core contributor to [Backbone Marionette](https://marionettejs.com/), built their first DevTools extension, and realized that [Chrome DevTools]() was open source.

In 2016, I joined the **Firefox DevTools** team, where I helped modernize the **Debugger** and built a community of 400 open source contributors.

In 2018, I met Brian Hackett who had been working on a research initiative to bring time-travel debugging to the browser. Two years later, [Replay.io](https://replay.io) was born as the first collaborative DevTools where anyone could inspect their application after the fact.
