In 2012, I attended **[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)**, started contributing to [Ruby](https://github.com/pry/pry) and [Python's](https://bpython-interpreter.org/) most popular debuggers, and learned about time-travel debugging.

After Recurse, I joined **Etsy**, became a core contributor to [Backbone Marionette](https://marionettejs.com/), built their first DevTools extension, and started contributing to [Chrome DevTools]().

In 2016, I joined the **Firefox DevTools** team, where I helped modernize the **Debugger** and built a community of 400 open source contributors.

In 2020, I co-founded [Replay.io](https://replay.io) with four goals: prove that it was possible to record and deterministically replay the browser, build a collaborative debugging experience that solved the reproducibility problem, productionize the first pure dynamic analysis engine, and scale web replay environments for RL in the spirit of Dota 2, Starcraft, and self driving.

Today, Replay.io is automating the debugging lifecycle for coding agents and I'm helping scale web RL environments and tasks within the **Amazon Autonomy** lab.
