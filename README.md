## Personal site

### Credit

This site draws inspiration from:

- `react/mdx` Lee Rob's video and personal site helped me see how naturally Next 15 supports MDX

- Lee Rob's personal site which highlighted Next'js MDX component
- Rauchg's personal site who's design puts the content front and center
- Vercel's demo blog which showed me how fetch pages
- ... site which helped me convert my old Jekyll site to NextJS

### Replace old blog

- [x] Get the post title and metadata
- [x] Add analytics, perf
- [x] metadata (title, favico)
- [x] Add static rendering
- [x] sitemap
- [x] Flip about and posts
- [x] Add theme picker
- [x] split notes and posts
- [x] improve theme

### Fast follow

- [ ] simplify the narrative
- [ ] Add a search box for posts
- [ ] sluggify headers
- [ ] dynamic og
- [ ] change the syntax highlighting theme
- [ ] remove src dir since it adds extra nesting
- [ ] confirm ai did not re-write the content of the posts
