## Personal site

### Credit

This site draws inspiration from:

- `react/mdx` Lee Rob's video and personal site helped me see how naturally Next 15 supports MDX

- Lee Rob's personal site which highlighted Next'js MDX component
- Rauchg's personal site who's design puts the content front and center
- Vercel's demo blog which showed me how fetch pages
- ... site which helped me convert my old Jekyll site to NextJS

### To do list

Replace old blog

- [x] Get the post title and metadata
- [x] Add analytics, perf
- [x] metadata (title, favico)
- [x] Add static rendering
- [x] sitemap

- [ ] split notes and posts
- [] sluggify headers
