## Personal site


### Credit

This site draws inspiration from:

- `react/mdx` Lee Rob's video and personal site helped me see how naturally Next 15 supports MDX

- Lee Rob's personal site which highlighted Next'js MDX component
- Rauchg's personal site who's design puts the content front and center
- Vercel's demo blog which showed me how fetch pages
- ... site which helped me convert my old Jekyll site to NextJS



### To do list

Replace old blog
- [x] Get the post title and metadata 
- [x] Add analytics, perf 
- [] metadata (title, favico)
 
Nice to haves
- [] sitemap
- [] sluggify headrs
- [] Add theme picker
- [] dynamic og
- [] Add static rendering 
- [] change the syntax highlighting theme 
- [] remove src dir since it adds extra nesting



This might be my OCD speaking, but I'm surprised it's difficult to pass meta


This might be my OCD speaking, but I'm surprised you have to do something like posts.json in order to pass page title and date with NextJS MDX.
